#' Sandpile
#'
#' Drop some sand in the center and see it spread outwards.
#'
#' @param n The number of grains dropped in the center.
#' @param colors A vector of length 4 or \code{NULL}. Specifies the colors to be
#'   allocated to the values \code{0:4}. If \code{NULL}, the number of grains
#'   per cell are returned instead. Defaults to a grey palette.
#'
#' @return A matrix, either containing colors or the number of grains per cell,
#'   depending on the value of \code{colors}.
